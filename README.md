## Bacterial colony counting

* The program grabs the pictures in the folder 'images/' and performs colony counting.
* The results are written in the file 'Bacterial Colony Counting.xlsx'
* In the output, the concentration of pathogen in the sample is computed using 

## Sample outputs
* Here are some samples of the detection algorithm trained with YOLOv8 deep learning architechture:
